VsKeyboardShortcutsDump
=======================

Usage
-----

After building and installing the VSIX package, simply choose "Dump Keyboard Shortcuts" from the Tools menu in Visual Studio. 

Every command with a keyboard shortcut will be dumped to the Output Window in a pane called Keyboard Shortcuts. The command name and shortcut(s) are separated by a tab for easy copy-pasting into Excel.

Tested on VS2010 SP1. Not guaranteed to work on other versions but it might.

This Visual Studio extension is basically a port to a C# VSPackage from the macro published on MSDN here:
